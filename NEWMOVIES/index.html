            The film, penned by Will Tracy and Seth Reiss, "focuses on a young couple who visits an exclusive
            destination restaurant on a remote island where the acclaimed chef has prepared a lavish tasting
            menu, along with some shocking surprise."Deadline notes, "Fiennes plays the world-class chef who
            sets it all up and adds some unexpected ingredients to the menu planned. The action follows one
